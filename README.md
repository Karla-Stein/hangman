PROJECT INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE 

Project Title: Hangman – A Classic Word Game reinvented for the Browser

This project is a modern, browser-based implementation of the classic game Hangman. Designed to be interactive, visually engaging and mobile-responsive, the game challenges players to guess hidden words within a limited number of attempts — combining entertainment with vocabulary-building in a fun and intuitive interface. Users interact with an on-screen keyboard, visual hangman graphics, and motivational feedback via modals, sound effects, and celebratory animations. The game tracks high scores using local storage, encouraging replayability and engagement.

The primary aim of this project is to create an engaging and educational game that is accessible to a wide range of users from children learning new words, to adults seeking a quick mental challenge during breaks. The game offers three levels of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard), making it suitable for users of varying skill levels. Players can also reset the high score, view detailed rules and switch word banks. All through a responsive and user-friendly interface.

I chose this project because I wanted to bring a nostalgic childhood game into a digital format while applying core JavaScript skills like DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, loops and also working with data structures like arrays. I was particularly drawn to the idea of building something both fun and functional, with plenty of room for stretch goals like audio feedback, confetti animations, hints, and different word categories.

As someone transitioning into web development, this project gave me the opportunity to challenge myself technically while building something lighthearted and enjoyable. It also allowed me to deepen my understanding of front-end interactivity and user experience design in a creative context.
